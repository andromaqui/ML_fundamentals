## 01.exercise-python-numpy-basics.ipynb
A number of quizes to get familiar with the Numpy library.

## 02.notebooks_math_linear-algebra_exercise-matrix-vector-operations.ipynb
Implementation of basic matrix operations, such as addition and multiplication without the standard methods included in the Numpy library.

## 03.notebooks_machine-learning-fundamentals_exercise-simple-linear-regression.ipynb
Implementation of **Linear Regression** with **Gradient Descent Algorithm**. Methods implemented in this module calculate the **Cost** of a linear function and apply the **Grandient Descent Algorithm** in order to find the line that best describes a Data Set, which can be expressed through a linear function.
